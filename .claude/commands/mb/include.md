# Include Memory Bank

When this command is invoked, you MUST:

1. Read ALL files in the `memory-bank/` directory

2. Apply the rules from:

   - `CLAUDE.md` (project root) - Contains Plan/Act mode rules and Memory Bank workflow rules
   - OR `.cursor/rules/core.mdc` and `.cursor/rules/memory-bank.mdc` if working in Cursor environment

3. Follow the Memory Bank workflows for the remainder of this session:
   - Update documentation when making significant changes
   - Follow Plan/Act mode as defined in the rules
   - Read memory bank files at the start of every task

This command activates the full Memory Bank system for complex tasks that require project context and documentation workflows.

**Cross-platform:** Works with both Cursor (`.cursor/rules/`) and Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`) environments.
